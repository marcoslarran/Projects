This place was right next to our hotel and I saw the reviews were great so I thought i'd give it a try. There was a HUGE line outside, but since I was by myself, they fit me in at the bar right away. SCORE!\\n\\nI asked the bartender what they recommend and they said they are known for their charbroiled oysters. Hmm never had them but I love oysters, sure give me a half dozen and some jambalaya. \\n\\nThese charbroiled oysters were seriously the BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN. They were juicy, buttery, smoky from the grill, and SO delicious.  I was shocked that something could be so delicious. I don't care how bad they are for you, they went directly to feed my soul. \\n\\nI ordered another dozen. Yes, just for me. Worth it. I still dream of those oysters. Go try them, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

At first, there was a long line around 5pm, but luckily we ended up not waiting very long at all. You can order fresh crawfish, even though I don't remember specifically seeing that on the menu. Ordered the Chargrilled Oysters and that ended up becoming my favorite dish. The butter and cheese melt on them were delicious, even if you are not normally a fan of oysters. The restaurant is high energy, and everyone goes there for larger parties and lots of fun! The bar and great authentic southern food makes it even better.\",\n",

We got hush puppies, dozen or so oysters, soft crab, seafood gumbo, and the meledy (plate that has andouille sausage, red beans and rice, gumbo and jambalaya. \\n\\nQuite the list indeed but me and and mah mama tore it up!\\n\\nOYSTERS is very good. They come to your table all bubbling from being cooked. You get like a couple of small ones but majority of the are huge. The bread that it comes with is best used to absorb the sauce. \\n\\nHUSH PUPPIES are a good appetizer and have very good flavor. I would say get them but instead GET MORE OYSTERS. \\n\\nGUMBO has great flavor and consistency. We got the cup instead of the bowl. The shrimp were flavored and you can tell they were not frozen. \\n\\nSOFT SHELL CRAB was delicious and it's wrong of me to do this but I had this from San Francisco and San Diego and honestly Bay Area wins. New Orleans and San Diego are tied.\\n\\nNEW ORLEANS MEDLEY I got in a whim because I couldn't decide which of those three I wanted. Now that I ate it I can say a little something. Andouille sausage was the best. I liked the jambalaya better than the gumbo. And the red beans and rice was my least favorite. \\n\\nOther honorable mentions:\\nWe didn't have to wait since there was just the 2 of us. \\nOur waitress tended to us in a speedy manner. \\nWe got none of the stuff that bothered other people. \\n\\nMy only gripe is that the gumbo cup and New Orleans medley obviously wouldn't fill you up.\"],\n",

I assumed they were preparing our dozen oysters on the half shell. We got our food but surprise, surprise, it was cold. And no oysters. I told our waitress...oh, you wanted oysters??\\n\\nAnyways, the shrimp poboy was fine, a fried shrimp sub...nothing special. Fries and grilled sausage for the little one were OK as well. My seafood etouffee was pretty good, though it really looked and tasted more like a seafood newburg than anything else. I thought the cup of fried crawfish tails looked like a generous portion, until I realized there was a thick piece of bread taking up two-thirds of the volume of the cup. When I finally got the oysters, they could not even bother to put ice or rock salt on the plate...it was just a dozen oysters, two wedges of lemon, and a cup of cocktail sauce. The oysters were quite good even though it was Memorial Day, plump and tasty. However, the shucking left quite a bit to be desired...each oyster was full of sand and dirt, ruining the taste. \\n\\nMeanwhile, it was a struggle to flag our waitress down for refills on our drinks. While I was waiting, I just happened to notice something drop from the ceiling onto the table into our drinks. It appeared that the ceiling was leaking! I told the waitress about it, and she said, thanks, that's just condensation from the AC. OK, so you know about it, don't warn us, and put our drink cups right under it?? Are you kidding!??\\n\\nWhat is fascinating to me is that for a city that is so dependent on the tourist trade, the people here really seem to hate and despise tourists. Friendly greetings and service was definitely the exception rather than the norm during our trip. I wonder if everyone was still hungover?\",\n",
       "       \"Definitely a chain, and all that comes with that. I thought everything was either just ok or just bad. Our waitress had all the life zapped out of her. They have three Abitas on tap, which is good. The boo fries we're gross. Kind of cold, with the cheap cheese not all the way melted on the cold fries. I got the peacemaker po boy. One of the reasons I got it was because I read all the Yelp reviews about how great it was, and the Tabasco mayo being so great. There was barely any mayo on there. The bread was pretty ok and the portions of seafood were generous, but on the whole the sandwich lacked flavor. There was nothing special about their oysters either- they just didn't make us sick.\",\n",
       "       'So...what is with all the hype over this place? We waited about an hour to get in and were excited because it had great reviews but we left feeling really disappointed. Not only was the interior old, outdated and ugly, which I don\\'t really care much about, but we tried all the \"best\" foods off the menu and it honestly tasted nothing. I was eating bland, blah, flavorless rice and beans, jambalaya, charcoal grilled oysters were kind of gross and anything that was fried had like no seasoning. I left that place hoping to find a Popeye\\'s chicken, and I did, because their red beans and rice is 10x better and I\\'m not even a fan of fast food at all. This place was a waste of time.

There\\'s always a line, which I guess I\\'d expect with the amount of marketing they do. Honestly, it\\'s good but why anyone would wait in line for an hour for oysters when there\\'s 10 oyster bars within a two-block radius is beyond me.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n*2 dozen chargrilled oysters ($19.99 dozen) \\n*craw balls app ($7)\\n*1x beer \\n\\nTotals was around $55 but we spent an extra $20 tipping the oyster shuckers at the raw bar for being kind human beings and here\\'s why:\\n\\nI brought a friend from out of town and Acme was her very first NOLA food experience (she had heard about it and very excitedly needed to go). \\n\\nIssue #1:\\nWe get in line and the hostess walks right past us and skips putting our name on the list. We had to stop and tell her the third time she passed - which was interesting because she asked the person directly in front of us and the person directly behind us both other times. Overlooked that, c\\'est la vie.\\n\\nIssue #2:\\nShe told me it would be a 30-minute wait and I should grab a drink so I said \"Good idea!\" and went off in search of libations. I returned moments later with two expensive daiquiris ($25 worth, not something I\\'d ever normally spend my $$ on but I was entertaining a guest) -- ten seconds later, our name was called (this was about four-five minutes after she told me 30 minutes. \\nExcitedly, we walked in and sat down at the bar with our daiquiris and a waitress/hostess immediately and rudely walks up and says \"no outside drinks!\" Our immediate response is that we didn\\'t want to waste the $25 nor spend more time in line, so we looked like two deer caught in headlights. She said it loud, two more times, meaner and more demanding each time. The oyster shucker looked at us, took pity, and grabbed our drinks, placing them under the bar out of sight then telling her we\\'re all set. She proceeded to bitch out her KIND coworkers in front of us for doing this which was entirely unacceptable. She then treated us like we had done something wrong when we even offered to throw them out because we wanted to stay and the nice shucker said not to worry about it. He told his manager who also seemed fine with it --- anyway, I\\'m just pissy because my friend\\'s very first Nola food experience was a bitchy hostess. One employee told me I had time to grab a drink, so I did. Then I got bitched at for having said drinks.  The three guys behind the bar were great and kind --- which was much appreciated. \\n\\nIssue #3: \\nI eat chargrilled oysters a lot. I\\'ve never had them so salty as these. They\\'re better at the little dive bar, MRB, on St. Phillip, and for $3 cheaper per dozen with a much nicer staff \\n...and no wait. \\n\\nI had hoped this would be a great experience, and I was really disappointed that it wasn\\'t even a good one.

Personally I should have walked out after waiting so long to get a server. Seemed like the servers were confused on who had my table.

My sister-in-law took two bites of her gumbo before declaring that it tasted like beef stew. My hushpuppies were barely warm, and my jambalaya was unevenly heated... HOT on one side, COLD in the middle, and warm-ish on the right. What the hell? Not only that, but both tasted like crap.

I understand that bad days happen, I'm human too, and waited tables for 8 years, I know it's not always the fault of the servers, just don't take it out on us and don't be mean!

Our fingers were riddled with dirt, and some of us had dirt on our lips. *Insert vomit face* I looked up at the friend across from me, and she had dirt all over her lips. She didn't even have the chance to eat the oyster; she just kissed it! When the waitress came by, we told her that we didn't like the oysters and wanted to send them back due to the above reason. She was very polite & professional. She took the oysters off of the bill, and shouted to the shuckers that they need to clean their oysters better.\\n\\nHere is a quick flashback of my life as an intern in the kitchen:\\nI, myself, had the lovely job of scrubbing oysters for dinner service before. Grunt work at its finest. If you are not familiar with oyster cleaning, there is a lovely, giant, upside brush which you place into a sink. You keep cold water running on the brush while you take 1 oyster at a time and scrub, scrub, scrub until all, or most, of the dirt and sand is off.\\n\\nBack to the review..\\nBecause of the oysters, our appetites were lost. We did not dare order entrees. The char broiled oysters and craw fish came out, and those were great. This 1 star review is for those dishes and for the professionalism in the waitress.\\n\\nSo I urge y'all NOT to come here. Spend your money elsewhere in a cleaner establishment. I should have known better when a friend of mine said he had major food poisoning from Acme just a few months prior.\",\n",

We did and not less than one minute later, she knocked on the window and yelled for us to follow her. She sat us in the back at a community table, without menus. She came back and gave us menus, told us who our server would be and walked off. We looked over the menus, and then sat and waited for about 15 minutes. The server never greeted us, never even took a drink order, never offered water, nothing.

The server obviously did not want our business,  or we would have at least been greeted. We sat right next to the wait station  where the POS was and we could hear a server and manager having an argument right in front of all the customers. There were two managers and two servers just standing around arguing and talking while all the customers around them watched and waited for service.\\n\\nWe decided that between the rude greeting from the hostess and the obviously poor service that this would not be a good experience, so we left.  There was another couple sitting next to us who had been sitting there before us and they said they were never greeted either. They asked where we were going, we told them our cab driver recommended another restaurant down the street & they decided to leave with us. I\\'ve only heard great things about the food there, but even the best food cannot compensate for horrible service. \\n\\nYesterday, we decided to visit another location in Metairie,  it was a completely different experience. Service was outstanding, the hostess, manager, and server were all very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself was clean and open, the complete opposite of the downtown location. Our server was efficient and the food was great and came out in a timely manner. We were pleasantly surprised and would happily recommend this location.',\n",

I didn't have the energy to complain yet again so I simply proceeded to eat the 4 out of 6 shells of oysters that were on my plate. The oysters were salty at best.

And the gravy tasted just like normal gravy one would have for breakfast biscuit or even mashed potatoes... \\n\\nThen the jambalaya. We only ordered a side size and the thing came already looking kinda unfresh. The first scoop confirmed it. Not only did the jambalaya tasted mushy but it was cold! We told a staff and he said he was going to get us a hotter one. Ha turns out they just microwaved it for maybe like 1 min or something. Doesn\\'t change the fact that it was awful jambayala. \\n\\nWe also ordered onion ring because my girlfriend came here two years ago and was very impressed with their onion ring. Well to say the least the breading tasted very dry and it felt like those onion rings were fried a long time ago and were just left out there.. \\n\\nWe were so dissatisfied and eventually the manager came. I mean one would probably expect a manager of a well known restaurant in the area to be really serious about these complaints about the food quality. But this manager straight up told me that he would take those off of my check and simply left... I was left in shock. Seriously it felt like he didn\\'t give a damn about what I have to say about their food and was sending the message that \"it\\'s cool if you don\\'t like it, we have a line waiting outside anyway\" I don\\'t know how a restaurant that doesn\\'t take customer complaint about food quality seriously can keep being successful... \\n\\nI\\'ll just leave it here - there are absolutely better options for seafood around the area if that\\'s what you are coming to NOLA for.

As I stood in the line and I look at all the people there are really could not understand how could I be treated me in this manner. I was one of the only African Americans besides the cooks and waitstaff. It was was a horrible experience for me I was very embarrassed.

       "       'Could not have had a worse experience. I am a veteran and getting married in a few weeks. I had never been to New Orleans before although all my friends had. Something always seemed to come up that prevented me from going. Often military obligation or family obligations. The first night we had dinner at Drago\\'s and it was incredible. I was completely relying on my friends as I had never been there before. The second night they said Acme Oyster house and I was excited because I heard it was good. We waited in a pretty long line, which was fine. We had 8 of us total but we were waiting for my one friend to get back after having to take our 9th friend in the group back because he wasn\\'t feeling well. My friend on the way back got turned around. Now I\\'m never going to leave a man behind, ever. So when we were at the front of the line I called him and he was close but still didn\\'t know how to get there. I said I\\'ll run, and I mean run, and go get him. I said I\\'d be back in 7 minutes. I was back in 8. I guess my friends had decided to just go ahead and sit down even though the A-hole who was seating people said you can\\'t sit without your whole party there. I guess that\\'s their policy. I got back with my friend in tow and I asked what happened. Of course with me being the bachelor a few offered to give up their seat because I was the main reason for being there. It became a big ordeal and I didn\\'t want to create a scene. So I said no I\\'ll just leave and go get in line and sit at another table. That was when that same A-hole sees me and shouts as he points \"YOU WERE NOT WITH THE ORIGINAL PARTY AND I DON\\'T GIVE A SHOT IF YOU ARE THE BACHELOR GET OUT AND DON\\'T COME BACK!!!!\\' Now obviously I was a little offended but again not wanting to further the scene that had been created I said \\'cool I\\'m out of here and I will never ever be back.\" I felt a little dejected but my friend that I went back for and 2 others came out and said they were sticking with me. We went right across the street the Felix\\'s. Could not have been more opposite of the experience that I had across the street. Our waiter was Melvin and we told him of our experience and then the whole staff wanted to know what I had done to get kicked out. They ended up buying us all sazeracs (a local concoction) and fed us well, very well, it was incredible. We ended up tipping Melvin around $75 because he helped salvage a night that had took a bad turn. Now some of my friends stayed at Acme and still say the food was the best, and that my be true, but to me they way you are treated is at least, if not more, important than what you eat, and they let me know in no uncertain terms that they cared nothing for me whatsoever. They will never get another chance with me and if I can help it no one I know will ever go there either.',\n",

       "       'MOST DISGUSTING RESTAURANT IVE EVER EATEN AT IN MY LIFE!\\n\\nLet me just start off by saying that I have worked in the food and beverage industry for quite some time. I have eaten tons of oyster from all different regions. I absolutely love oysters! So I made my party of 6 cut our Ghost tour short in order to get to this place. I was beyond excited. And boy were all the reviews on here misleading. We ordered crab cakes, chargrilled oysters (they were out of at the moment), gumbo, Rockefeller oyster soup, craw puppies and hush puppies, and red beans and rice.\\n\\nOur waitress had no idea what kind of oysters they were. She just said Louisiana. Should have gone with my gut at that moment and bailed. So when she dropped our order and was missing the oysters she said they\\'ll be out in about 5 mins. 5 mins later she drops the check without even asking us. Which by the way my oysters and things were not on. Very strange, but I remained patient. 30 mins later we still haven\\'t gotten the oysters. The entire table was done with their food except for me. So I remind her again and she says and I quote \"well I can get you the Rockefeller oyster soup now, but the oysters will take 10 more minutes.\" As in she forgot about those items. When she brings out the plates of oysters my food and safety training kicked in and let me tell you that what I saw made my skin crawl. Imagine where those oysters come from. The bottom of the ocean floor. So they are covered in muck and put into bags or boxes and shipped like that. To a place where they are cleaned and shucked for one to consume, after they are neatly arranged on a metal tray on top of a bed of ice. My oysters came in a disgusting plastic food tray (the kind that are used to bring drinks to people in cheap bars that don\\'t have the nice metal ones.) The plastic tray was filthy dirty like muddy water about half an inch deep is what the oysters were sitting on. But I said you know what? Maybe I\\'m spoiled from working in fine dining establishments (even though I\\'ve been to plenty Oceanside oyster bars that are cheap oyster haunts) but I digress. So I put on my big girl pants and gave it a go. Upon closer inspection the oyster had tons of debris in them, as in they were never rinsed so that shards of oyster shell that pierce your gums that normally get removed by the chef were still floating around. There was tons of sediment inside the oyster. But again I said let\\'s not be spoiled and give it a go. And when I put the oyster to my mouth to swallow mine down, I was left with a mud mustache on my lips and around my mouth. MUD! So I check to see if maybe it was just a bad one, and the entire batch appeared to have never been rinsed or cleaned. I left the other 11 on the plate! IVE NEVER LEFT AN OYSTER IN MYLIFE! I\\'m pretty sure that I\\'ll be getting some sort of parasite from there. And it is beyond me who would rate this place anything but a 1 star. The best thing we ate was the red beans and rice. That was delicious but I\\'d never step foot in this place again. I\\'d gladly pay more money to go to any of the other oyster houses down the street where the food is more expensive but you can bet your ass those oysters come with no health warning on a clean tray on a nice bed of ice. Oh and to top it off the oyster Rockefeller soup had 1 oyster in it and was more of a spinach dip. She gave me free red beans and rice for it and brought back an even more expensive bill, which proved she never rang in those late items to begin with. Horrible dining experience.',\n",
       "       \"My friends and I came to this establishment with a few others on their way. The hostess with the tattoo on her neck was extremely rude. We were so put off by their attitude that we left. We waited all weekend to come to this restaurant and highly disappointed at how we were treated from the get go. You don't talk to patrons like their business doesn't matter to yours!\",\n",
       "       'Came here on 12/29/16 with a party of 8 people. Waited outside in the cold for an hour then were sat right by the front door where employees and people came in and out every 30-45 seconds allowing the freezing air to blow on everyone at the table. We asked our waiter to be moved and they were happy to and asked us to wait a minute while they were clearing another table. Meanwhile the manager (a heavy white male, didn\\'t get his name) came over and told us we wouldn\\'t fit at that table. I had already looked at the table and it had 7 chairs, no biggie we would squeeze in if it meant getting away from the busy front door. The manager said again, no we won\\'t fit in which I told him it would be fine we would fit. He than told me \"we were not going to play musical chairs, everyone else has sat at this very table all day with no complaints\". WOW, the rudest manager I have ever encountered. So we sat and froze. One of our guests ordered the large bowl of seafood gumbo which came out in a saucer about an 1\" deep and 6\" across. We asked another gentleman (different from first one who was rude) about the size and he was quick to snap back saying that was for sure the large. I asked how many ounces were in the small and large gumbos to which he responded with 6oz in the small cup and 8oz in the large bowl. I then asked to speak to the manager again and he responded with \"oh I am the manager\" and walked away. WORST customer service I\\'ve ever received! The food was average but too pricey for the portions received. The actual waitstaff was extremely nice and helpful but the two \"managers\" were garbage.',\n",

We saw approximately 15 people be walked into the restaurant in front of us.  It was extremely frustrating. I felt sorry for the door staff and even managers who then blamed it on the owner.  The food was so, so and was not worth waiting 2.5 hours.  My review is primarily to the owner.  You should make a decision and if you want to allow this to continue then please let the \"Go to the front of the line\" people go to a different door.

The line was shorter than expected which should have been the first red flag. \\n\\nWhen we were up next to be seated the host came out to tell us they were no longer serving raw or chargrilled oysters. As we stood there scratching our heads we saw several people inside eating raw and chargrilled oysters. \\n\\nWe were seated and sure enough, they told us they weren't serving them. We ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our food, the guy working the oyster bar told us the manager decided to stop selling oysters so the employees could get out of there quicker since it's been a long day for them. They were also closing 2 hours earlier than their sign, Google, and their website said. \\n\\nThis was such a disappointing visit. We understand it was a holiday, but it's unacceptable to stop selling your namesake just to get your employees out earlier. There are way too many other restaurants to choose from to be treated like this.\"],\n",
